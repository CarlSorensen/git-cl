git-cl was originally written for use in the development of Google
Chrome.  Since I released it, git-cl was adopted by the Chrome team
and merged into their development repositories, and this public repo
was abandoned.

If you'd like to find the version of the code from before its
relocation, you can checkout master~1 from this repo.

Otherwise, for the current version (which may have some Chrome-isms in
it, I'm not sure) you'll want to find Chrome's "depot_tools"
repository, which currently lives at
  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
