# git-cl -- a git-command for integrating reviews on Rietveld
# Copyright (C) 2008 Evan Martin <martine@danga.com>

== Background
Rietveld, also known as http://codereview.appspot.com, is a nice tool
for code reviews.  You upload a patch (and some other data) and it lets
others comment on your patch.

Rietveld's patch uploader has support for Git (implemented by me).  But
you still need to keep track of the review issue number for subsequent
reviews.  git-cl brings the Rietveld integration more closely into Git.

== Install
Copy (symlink) it into your path somewhere, along with Rietveld
upload.py.

== Setup
$ git cl config
From your git checkout will cause it to ask you some questions.

== How to use it
Make a new branch.  Write some code.  Send it for review:
$ git cl upload
By default, it diffs against the git-svn branch.
An optional last argument is passed to "git diff", allowing reviews
against other heads.
You'll be asked some questions, and the review issue number will be
associated with your current git branch, so subsequent calls to upload
will update that review rather than making a new one.

Review looks good?  Commit the code:
$ git cl dcommit
This does a git-svn dcommit, with a twist: all changes in the diff
will be squashed into a single commit, and the description of the commit
is taken directly from the Rietveld description.  This command also accepts
an argument, much like upload.

== Extra commands
Print some status info:
$ git cl status

Edit the issue association on the current branch:
$ git cl issue 1234

Patch in a review:
$ git cl patch <url to full patch>
Try "git cl patch --help" for more options.
