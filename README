# git-cl -- a git-command for integrating reviews on Rietveld
# Copyright (C) 2008 Evan Martin <martine@danga.com>

== Background
Rietveld, also known as http://codereview.appspot.com, is a nice tool
for code reviews.  You upload a patch (and some other data) and it lets
others comment on your patch.

Rietveld's patch uploader has support for Git (implemented by me).  But
you still need to keep track of the review issue number for subsequent
reviews.  git-cl brings the Rietveld integration more closely into Git.

== Install
Copy (symlink) it into your path somewhere, along with Rietveld
upload.py.

== Setup
Tell it which server to upload to:
$ git config rietveld.server codereview.appspot.com

Optionally tell it a default CC mailing list for new reviews:
$ git config rietveld.cc my-code-reviews@wherever.com

== How to use it
Make a new branch.  Write some code.  Send it for review:
$ git cl upload trunk...
The last argument is passed to "git diff".
You'll be asked some questions, and the review issue number will be
cached in your .git directory, so subsequent calls to upload will
be on the same review.

Review looks good?  Commit the code:
$ git cl dcommit
This does a git-svn dcommit, with a twist: all changes on the branch
will be squashed into a single commit, and the description of the commit
is taken directly from the Rietveld description.

== Extra commands
Print some status info:
$ git cl status

Edit the issue association on a branch:
$ git cl issue 1234

Patch in a review as a new branch:
$ git cl patch <url to full patch>
